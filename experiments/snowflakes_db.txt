*Snowman*:
One little snowflake with nothing to do
Along came another and
Then there were two
Two little snowflakes laughing with me
Along came another and
Then there were three
Three little snowflakes looking for some more
Along came another and
Then there were four
Four little snowflakes dancing a jive
Along came another and
Then there were five
Five little snowflakes having so much fun
Out came the sun and
Then there were none!
