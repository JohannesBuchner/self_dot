We want to be able to associate:
- words uttered within the same sentence
- words uttered by the same person
- words uttered within a specific time (context), may be dynamic for each query
- words uttered within the same session/conversation (continuous talk with one person)
- similar words (similar sound), for text, we might just count the longest sequence of common letters

The query for generating new sentences will commonly be 
getNextWord()

This function may have arguments to set the scope for association
(sentence, person, timeContext, conversation, similarWord)
The arguments may be optional, and if not secified allow the widest possible search space
